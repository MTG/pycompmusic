Installation
============

This library is designed for python 3.4+, and python 2 is not longer supported. 
However, for previous releases we support python 2 on a best-effort basis.

It is recommended to install pycompmusic and dependencies into a virtualenv.
Do it like this:

    virtualenv -p python3 env
    source env/bin/activate
    python setup.py install

If you want to be able to edit files and have the changes be reflected, then
install compmusic like this instead

    pip install -e .

Now you can install the rest of the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Documentation
=============

There are sphinx docs available in the `docs` directory. Install sphinx to be able to build them

    pip install sphinx
    
to build the docs run
    
    make html
    
from the root directory.
